### Project Name : My Blog Platform

The "My Blog Platform" is a lightweight, interactive web application designed for users to create, publish, and view blog posts. The application features a user-friendly interface and utilizes a simple, dynamic layout to allow for seamless post creation and viewing.

#### Key Features:

1. **Theme Toggle**: The platform includes a theme toggle button that allows users to switch between light and dark modes. This provides users with the flexibility to personalize their browsing experience, enhancing accessibility and visual appeal.

2. **New Post Creation**: Users can create a new blog post by clicking the "New Post" button, which reveals a form for inputting a post title and content. This form includes fields for the post's title and a textarea for writing the content. Users can either publish the post or cancel the action. When the post is published, it is dynamically displayed on the main page.

3. **Responsive Layout**: The application is designed with a responsive layout to ensure it works smoothly across different devices, such as desktops, tablets, and smartphones. This makes the platform accessible and usable on various screen sizes.

4. **Dynamic Content Display**: The posts are dynamically rendered in the "posts" section once they are submitted, providing an instant, interactive experience. This feature enables users to see their content in real-time without page refreshes.

5. **Clean and Minimalist Design**: The overall design of the platform is minimalistic and straightforward, focusing on ease of use and a clutter-free user interface. The design adapts to different user preferences with a simple, intuitive layout.
